        <h2 id="TJ" class="medium"> <strong>Meet TJ</strong> </h2>
            <p> Several years ago I adopted a dog from Partners from Pets.  He was
                a 6 month old lab mix, and he was a <strong>stubborn</strong>, <fancy>
                    destructive</fancy> pain in the butt.</p>
            <img src = "images/TJ1.jpg" alt = "TJ1" height = "142" width="142"> 
            <img src = "images/TJ.jpg" alt = "TJ" height = "142" width="200">
            <img src = "images/TJ 2.jpg" alt = "TJ2" height = "142" width="142"> 
            <br>
            This is TJ.
            <p> We tried everything in the book to get him trained: took him to training classes, crate training, 
                sprayed with vinegar water, electronic collars, electronic fence.  Through it all, he stubbornly maintained
                that he was his own &apos;dog&apos;, and he frequently illustrated this through numerous chewed up shoes, 
                torn off door frames, holes under the fence, and dragging me down the street.  Despite all of the trials 
                and tribulations, he was my dog and I loved him. </p>

        <h1 class="center large">The Discovery of a Passion</h1>
            <h2>TJ was the beginning</h2>
                <p> Over the years, I would stop by PetSmart to just &apos;look&apos; at the dogs.  I had three dogs already.
                    In addition to TJ, I had Angel and Tasha, 12 year old border collie mixes.  I couldn't possibly manage or
                    afford another dog.  TJ had already cost me a fortune.  But they were so dang cute, and what was the harm
                    in looking, right?</p>
                <p> After coming regularly for several weeks, one of the volunteers from Partners for Pets started a conversation.
                    That conversation started with, &quot;no,no,no, I'm really not looking for a dog,&quot; and ended with me 
                    going home with a beagle named Howie.</p>
                <img src="images/Howie.jpg" alt = "Howie" height = "142" width="200">
                <br>
                This is Howie
                <p> So what happened there?  Well, Partners for Pets needs fosters.  The majority of dogs they rescue stay at the
                    shelter, but bringing one home just gives it a much better shot at becoming adopted.  The dog learns things
                    in your home it just doesn't have the opportunity to at the shelter. They become socialized with other dogs, learn
                    basic commands and learn how to live in a home.  By bringing Howie home, I was saving his adopter from having
                    to go through the same trials and tribulations I did when I adopted TJ.  Or at least, hopefully, making it
                    a little bit easier. </p>

            <h2>Over 40 dogs later...</h2>
                <p>  I've had three momma dogs with litters of puppies, two of which gave birth in my basement.  I've had pit
                    bulls, bull terriers, St. Bernard, collie, mastiff, rat terriers, jack russell terriers, lab mixes and
                    a partridge in a pear tree.  I've loved each and every one and pray I've been able to make their transition
                    to their furr-ever homes so much easier.  I could never have done any of it without the tremendous support
                    and advice from the volunteers and staff at Partners for Pets. </p>
